# lock_in_photocurrent
GUI calculator to determine photocurrent from lock-in experiment with modulated light source.
Python 3.
Once compiled as an executable (e.g. Pyinstaller), the user can quickly calculate a current signal in amps from on the lock-in amplifier output and lock-in/preamplifier sensitivities.
